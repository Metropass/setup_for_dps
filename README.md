# setup_for_dps
A setup.py template if you want to make a proper CLI. This will allow the user to call your script without running a .py file. 

# Use

When building your .py script, open your Console/Terminal and go to your directory that contains the .py file.
Once you're there, insert the following:
#pip3 install --editable .

This will build your CLI Script and you will have access to edit your code dynamically, and you can execute your script by using the keyword you've chosen, instead of running a .py file.
